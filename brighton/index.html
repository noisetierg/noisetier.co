Arrival of the railways in 1841 helped it become a popular destination for day-trippers from London. Brighton joined Hove to form the unitary authority of Brighton and Hove in 1997, which was granted city status in 2000.[3] As of 2017, Brighton and Hove had a resident population of about 290,885. Brighton has been described as the UK's "hippest city",[4] "the happiest place to live in the UK",[5] and the "unofficial gay capital of the UK".[6]</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fgn6t5je19">Secondary Heading</h3><p>The first settlement in the Brighton area was Whitehawk Camp, a Neolithic encampment on Whitehawk Hill which has been dated to between 3500 BC and 2700 BC.[17] It is one of six causewayed enclosures in Sussex. Archaeologists have only partially explored it, but have found numerous burial mounds, tools and bones, suggesting it was a place of some importance.[18] There was also a Bronze Age settlement at Coldean. Brythonic Celts arrived in Britain in the 7th century BC,[17] and an important Brythonic settlement existed at Hollingbury Castle on Hollingbury Hill. This Celtic Iron Age encampment dates from the 3rd or 2nd century BC and is circumscribed by substantial earthwork outer walls with a diameter of c. 1,000 feet (300 m). Cissbury Ring, roughly 10 miles (16 km) from Hollingbury, is suggested to have been the tribal "capital".[19]</p><h4 id="mcetoc_1fgn6t5je1a">Third One</h4><p>Later, there was a Roman villa at Preston Village, a Roman road from London ran nearby, and much physical evidence of Roman occupation has been discovered locally.[17] From the 1st century AD, the Romans built a number of villas in Brighton and Romano-British Brythonic Celts formed farming settlements in the area.[20] After the Romans left in the early 4th century AD, the Brighton area returned to the control of the native Celts. Anglo-Saxons then invaded in the late 5th century AD, and the region became part of the Kingdom of Sussex, founded in 477 AD by king Ælle.[21]</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1fgn6t5je1b">Fourth one</h5><p>Anthony Seldon identified five phases of development in pre-20th century Brighton.[22] The village of Bristelmestune was founded by these Anglo-Saxon invaders, probably in the early Saxon period. They were attracted by the easy access for boats, sheltered areas of raised land for building and better conditions compared to the damp, cold and misty Weald to the north.[23] By the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 it was a fishing and agricultural settlement, a rent of 4,000 herring was established, and its population was about 400.[7][17] By the 14th century there was a parish church, a market and rudimentary law enforcement (the first town constable was elected in 1285).[24]</p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="1920px" height="1080px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5AcCQnx_XTA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p class="dropcap">Sacked and burnt by French invaders in the early 16th century—the earliest depiction of Brighton, a painting of c. 1520, shows Admiral Pregent de Bidoux's attack of June 1514—the town recovered strongly based on a thriving mackerel-fishing industry.[25]</p><p>The grid of streets in the Old Town (the present Lanes area) were well developed and the town grew quickly: the population rose from c. 1,500 in 1600 to c. 4,000 in the 1640s.[17] By that time Brighton was Sussex's most populous and important town.[25] Having lost the Battle of Worcester, King Charles II, after hiding for 42 days in various places, fled on the evening of 15 October 1651 in the "Surprise" from Brighthelmstone to his exile in Fécamp, France.</p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d40330.75801749027!2d-0.16961888204131467!3d50.818708534499976!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x48758509f6294167%3A0x9cc6af7a727d0ef9!2sBrighton!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1632866808463!5m2!1sen!2suk" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><h6 id="mcetoc_1fgn6t5je1c">Fifth one</h6><p>Over the next few decades, though, events severely affected its local and national standing, such that by 1730 "it was a forlorn town decidedly down on its luck". More foreign attacks, storms (especially the devastating Great Storm of 1703), a declining fishing industry, and the emergence of nearby Shoreham as a significant port caused its economy to suffer.[25]</p><p class="msg msg--success">By 1708 other parishes in Sussex were charged rates to alleviate poverty in Brighton, and Daniel Defoe wrote that the expected £8,000 cost of providing sea defences was "more than the whole town was worth". The population declined to 2,000 in the early 18th century.[17]</p><p>From the 1730s, Brighton entered its second phase of development—one which brought a rapid improvement in its fortunes. The contemporary fad for drinking and bathing in seawater as a purported cure for illnesses was enthusiastically encouraged by Dr Richard Russell from nearby Lewes. He sent many patients to "take the cure" in the sea at Brighton, published a popular treatise[note 1] on the subject, and moved to the town soon afterwards (the Royal Albion, one of Brighton's early hotels, occupies the site of his house).[27] Others were already visiting the town for recreational purposes before Russell became famous, and his actions coincided with other developments which made Brighton more attractive to visitors. From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France; road transport to London was improved[28] when the main road via</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">Crawley was turnpiked in 1770;[29] and spas and indoor baths were opened by other entrepreneurial physicians such as Sake Dean Mahomed and Anthony Relhan (who also wrote the town's first guidebook).[28]</p><pre>From 1780, the development of the Georgian terraces had started, and the fishing village developed as the fashionable resort of Brighton. The growth of the town was further encouraged by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) after his first visit in 1783.[30] He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the Royal Pavilion during the early part of his Regency. In this period the modern form of the name Brighton came into common use.[31]</pre><blockquote><p>A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of Preston Barracks in 1793.[32] It was rebuilt in 1830.</p></blockquote><div class="gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-columns="4"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://noisetier.co/media/posts/3/gallery/L1002778.jpg" data-size="2276x3420"><img loading="lazy" src="https://noisetier.co/media/posts/3/gallery/L1002778-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1154"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://noisetier.co/media/posts/3/gallery/L1002781.jpg" data-size="2200x3306"><img loading="lazy" src="https://noisetier.co/media/posts/3/gallery/L1002781-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1154"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://noisetier.co/media/posts/3/gallery/L1002772.jpg" data-size="2029x3049"><img loading="lazy" src="https://noisetier.co/media/posts/3/gallery/L1002772-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1154"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://noisetier.co/media/posts/3/gallery/L1002775.jpg" data-size="3463x5204"><img loading="lazy" src="https://noisetier.co/media/posts/3/gallery/L1002775-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1154"></a></figure></div></div><p class="msg msg--info">The population increased rapidly in the 19th century.

Prior to either of these structures, the famous Chain Pier was built, to the designs of Captain Samuel Brown.

The major expansion of 1928 also incorporated the villages of Patcham, Ovingdean and Rottingdean, and much council housing was built in parts of Woodingdean after the Second World War. By the 1970s, the town had acquired a reputation as a retirement destination, with an elderly population.[37] However, this was reversed in the 1990s, as gentrification saw Brighton regain the fashionable status it held in the 18th and 19th centuries, due in no small part to a burgeoning LGBT population.<p></p><pre><code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"># Python program to check if the input number is odd or even.</span>
